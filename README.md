## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a school district's standardized test results. The analysis covers various aspects such as school budgets, reading and math scores, school sizes, and types. It aims to identify trends and insights to aid the school board and district officials in making informed decisions for future educational strategies and policies.

## Repository Contents
- `schools_complete.csv`: CSV file containing data about schools in the district.
- `students_complete.csv`: CSV file with student test scores and demographic information.
- `School_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- **District Summary**: A high-level overview of the district's overall performance, including average math and reading scores, passing rates, total budget, and number of schools and students.
- **School Summary**: Detailed metrics for each school, including type, size, budget, and academic performance.
- **Performance by School Size and Type**: Analysis of how school size (small, medium, large) and type (Charter, District) impact student performance.
- **Budget Analysis**: Assessment of the relationship between per-student spending and academic outcomes.
- **Grade-Level Performance**: Comparison of average math and reading scores across different grade levels in each school.

## Key Findings
- **Charter vs. District Schools**: Charter schools generally outperform District schools in terms of average scores and passing rates.
- **Influence of School Size**: Smaller and medium-sized schools demonstrate higher academic performance compared to larger schools.
